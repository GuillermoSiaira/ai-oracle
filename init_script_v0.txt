ai-oracle-v0
This repo is a scaffold prepared to integrate AI_Oracle later with minimal conflicts.

Layout
apps/v0_web: future web client (do not use next_app name)
docs_v0: documentation isolated from AI_Oracle docs
compose/docker-compose.v0.yml: any v0 services (avoid root-level docker-compose.yml)
Integration Plan
We will pull AI_Oracle either via:

git subtree add --prefix apps/ai_oracle <repo> main
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories (less recommended early)
Follow the team’s merge playbook.

Conventions:

Do NOT add a root-level docker-compose.yml (use compose/docker-compose.v0.yml).
Do NOT create folders named next_app, abu_engine, lilly_engine, or docs.
Keep all v0-specific documentation under docs_v0/.
After creation: add AI_Oracle via subtree or merge according to integration decision.
